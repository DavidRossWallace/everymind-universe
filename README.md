# everymind-universe
Next generation of everyMind. A distributed graph database and prediction index manager.

Everymind universe will be built on a new, distributed graph architecture. The original everyGraphs consisted of single, in-memory library files, and the Everymind manager was primarely javascript based. The new everyGraph universe distributes graphs into multiple files, galaxies (different servers) and Universes (collection of galaxies).
